# Ardalis.SharedKernel
Some useful base classes, mainly used with the CleanArchitecture template. Also, a template to make your own SharedKernel nuget package.

## Make Your Own!

You should probably fork or copy the classes in this repo and create your own `Acme.SharedKernel` package! Host it on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) or better yet, your own private package feed. This is not a supported package and is really only intended as a demo for use with the [Clean Architecture Solution Template]([https://github.com/ardalis/cleanarchitecture](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ardalis.CleanArchitecture.Template/)https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ardalis.CleanArchitecture.Template/)
